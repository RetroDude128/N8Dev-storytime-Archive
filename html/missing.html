    <p>N8Dev's server is a place for gamedevs, artist, programmers, and lots more!<br> And I think I saw a wild BenBonk lurking around
    <h2>What do we do in the server?</h2>
    <p>All sorts of things, if you're lucky and it's a sunday, you just might witness one of our amazing movie nights. Honestly,<br>
      they're not as common as they used to be. You can get help from people with the same talents from you in the Help channels.<br>
